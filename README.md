> A Web3-powered platform that rewards individuals in underserved regions for verifiable eco-friendly actions, connecting local environmental stewardship to global carbon credit markets.

## üåç Overview

EcoLink addresses the critical gap between small-scale environmental contributors and global carbon markets. While the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow from $2 billion to over $50 billion by 2030, communities in low-income or rural areas remain excluded from these financial benefits despite their vital role in climate action.

Our platform leverages blockchain technology to:
- **Track and authenticate** sustainable activities
- **Issue tokenized proof** of environmental impact
- **Connect verified actions** to global carbon credit buyers
- **Enable financial inclusion** through environmental stewardship

## üöÄ Key Features

### üîê Decentralized Verification
- Community-based validation system
- Weighted voting mechanism (Verifiers + Governors)
- Transparent on-chain governance

### üí∞ Token Economics
- **EcoToken (ECO)**: Capped-supply utility token
- Reward system for verified environmental actions
- Staking mechanism for validators

### üì± Mobile-First Design
- Accessible interface for low-resource environments
- Step-by-step guidance for action submission
- Real-time reward tracking

### üå± Environmental Impact
- Reforestation projects
- Clean energy adoption
- Sustainable agriculture
- Ecosystem conservation

### Integration Points
- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage for proof assets
- **Event System**: Real-time UI updates
- **View Functions**: Proposal tracking and user activity

## üë• User Roles

### üõ°Ô∏è Protectors
- Register for free
- Submit environmental action proposals
- Earn ECO tokens + NFT badges for approved actions

### ‚úÖ Verifiers
- Stake 50 ECO tokens
- Vote on proposal validity
- Receive proportional rewards

### üèõÔ∏è Governors
- Pre-assigned trusted validators
- Double-weighted voting power
- Governance incentives

## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Registration**: Users register as Protectors
2. **Staking**: Verifiers stake ECO tokens
3. **Submission**: Protectors submit proposals with IPFS proof
4. **Voting**: 7-day voting window with weighted consensus
5. **Execution**: Approved proposals trigger rewards and NFT minting

## üìä Business Model

### Value Creation
- Converts local environmental actions into verifiable digital assets
- Bridges small-scale contributions to global sustainability financing
- Creates inclusive, data-rich foundation for carbon markets

### Value Proposition
- **For Communities**: Access to previously inaccessible carbon markets
- **For Buyers**: Transparently verified carbon credits with social co-benefits
- **For Ecosystem**: Democratized environmental finance

### Revenue Streams
- Transaction fees on carbon credit sales
- Staking utility within token ecosystem
- Marketplace facilitation services
